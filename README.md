  ## Project Description
  This project is a working model of a fictional backend of a sales website. I wanted to get more familiar with backend technology, and thought this would be the perfect way to test my skills. On load one can see all the products, tags, and categories working in sync with each other to create an interconnected sales network.

  ## Installation
  Download the files, use NPM I to install the package, also change the .env file to work for your specific username and password. Then use node seeds to run the seed data, and node server to start the server! From there you can check out all the api routes, update, or delete the information!

  ## Usage
  Just use it if you need practice with backend technology, or if you need a lil refresher on how it works!

  ## How to Contribute
  I am always open to new ideas with my code! In the future I plan on reworking this entire application using async and await, to get practice with those kinds of functions!

  ## Testing
  As stated above, just messing around with the project should be more than enough! If you want to add more categories, or tags, and see how the system handles them that would be wonderful!
